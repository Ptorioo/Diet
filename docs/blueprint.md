## Core Features:

- Preference Selection: Rapid-fire selection of restaurant type preferences using a multiple-choice interface.
- Weather Integration: Use algorithm to refine the restaurant search and ordering based on current weather conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.) to affect final restaurant score, such as de-prioritizing restaurants without patio seating.
- Results Display: Display restaurant search results that are ordered by the app's calculated score, and indicate what factors went into the scoring. This could affect UI aspects such as the display density of search results. The 'top' few suggestions will be given emphasis.  
- Mock Location: Simulate location-based services via mocked/hardcoded nearby restaurant data.
- Landing page: The landing page must be aesthetically pleasing, to draw in the user. If it is dull, they are likely to go elsewhere.
